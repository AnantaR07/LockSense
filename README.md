# 🔐 Locksense – Smart IoT Door Access System

Locksense is a secure, web-based smart door access system built using **React** and **Firebase**, integrated with **RFID authentication** and **RSA encryption**. It allows users to remotely control and monitor door access (especially second-layer doors) from any device.

This system combines frontend web technologies with IoT hardware (e.g., ESP32 and RFID modules), ensuring real-time control, secure authentication, and cloud-based access logging.

## 🚀 Features

- 🆔 RFID-based user authentication
- 🔐 RSA key validation for added security
- 🌐 Remote access control through responsive web interface
- 🔄 Real-time database and user state syncing with Firebase
- 📜 Access logs and permission management stored in the cloud
- 📲 Built with React for modern UI and dynamic interaction

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- React.js  
- Firebase (Auth, Realtime DB)  
- ESP32 (IoT Microcontroller)  
- RFID Reader + Servo  
- RSA Encryption (Client-side or via microcontroller logic)
